Hello everyone, Just stumbled upon this reddit and I thought I'd share my expirence quitting and any advice I might have giving up the poison. Might as well warn you now that this is an extended ramble and a rock solid wall of text so I'll mark a separate section below just for tips. ---Quitting--- I had my last drink December 26th 2015 at the age of 24. I had started drinking at 18, but i wasn't until I was about 22 that it became a serious problem for me. It kinda crept up on me, I didn't.

Adventures (probably) don't exist in a void. They happen in a world, and that world should be logically consistent and directly affect the adventures that play out in it. On that note, I'm hoping to start writing posts about large-scale world building, starting at one of the "smallest" large-scale units: settlements. These are ten different types of cities, each with different architectural layouts, personalities, and potential quest hooks. These ideas can help guide your city creation, hopef. I Within Temptation sono un gruppo musicale olandese. Sono annoverati tra le più famose band nella scena symphonic/gothic di fine anni novanta e sono noti soprattutto per la voce della cantante soprano Sharon den Adel, tra le più apprezzate in ambito metal.  
I strongly believe that to understand how each type views the world, you look at the art they make and swear by. For this purpose, I started r/MBTIRadioStation so that there's a place to discuss Music + MBTI or anything for that matter. I think musicians and artists explore a lot of their psyche and shadow through their art. Art is the greatest healer! To understand the music r/INTJ likes and loves, I searched for "music" on the searchbar and pulled out some of the songs you peeps have posted.

They’re Peter Pan and Tinker Bell, the magical child and the manic pixie dream girl. Rachel is Max aged up, reborn and transformed in a ritual of fiery lust. Chloe is the Kewpie mayo, Max is the mustard and Rachel is the ketchup (or hawt sauce) to Frank’s Hawt Dawg Man.

I work for a non-profit advocacy. I love the work and the people I work with. And just for clarity’s sake, I’m a white cis-male that presents as heterosexual, though the majority of my co-workers are women of a variety of ethnicities and orientations. There is one other guy that works there as an advocate who started just a couple months before me. amp#x200B; Now a little background on me, I’ve had sort of strange and varied life, from working as a drum-tech to military service to working.

I go by what the music tells me to do, and some songs want a slowly fading ending, fading on into the distance, sometimes feeling like it goes off into the distance, sometimes to give the impression of never ending. (Thank you guys for being so patient. I've been trying to really put my best into this little write up, but I admit not only is it a bit late, but a bit long winded too.) My personal “verse” that would describe how I felt about the conference would probably be 1 Peter 1.22 gtYou were cleansed from your sins when you obeyed the truth, so now you must show sincere love to each other as brothers and sisters.

I tried this before but I’ll try it again. I’m on day 0 and I’m gonna document how I feel at the gym and how I sleep. My hypothesis is that my sleep will go down from like 9-12 hours to 7-9 hours, and my gym performance will improve (more reps/weight, more energy). #Sleep: Day 1: (8/23-24) Slept 13 hours and 47 minutes. About 10 pm to 11 am. It was this much because I stayed up all night the day before to reset my sleep schedule (been sleeping at 4 am+ and school starts soon). Slept within.

What’s in it: A few years of intense self-experimentation condensed to nine principles. This isn’t everything you need — not even close — but it’s a start. Reposted in its entirety from Homescreen Zero (http://homescreenzero.com/counter-programming-a-brai. The clock struck (if you could call it that) 6:50. We had been cooped up in the pantry for ten hours. Baby Thor was fretting for attention. Mon Cul was complaining about the length of his shift (in the wilds a baboon sentry is relieved after five hours). I was hungry, tired and damn near suffo- cated by cigar smoke. Purcell and I had at last reached an area of relative agreement. Hi reddit, Initially this started out as a typical 365 Albums in 365 Days challenge. We’ve seen them before haven’t we? You’ve probably even tried one yourself I imagine. I enjoy keeping lists, and tracking what I do over a particular. I already keep a list of what films I watch throughout a year, what books I’ve read, and so on. It only made sense for me to track the albums I listen to, and that’s how I ended up doing the challenge. However, I found myself also listening to a wide range Many of us have had role models. Some of them have been family members, friends, maybe even strangers you met one day that had expressed a collection of qualities that you would see as the way men were supposed to be. Whether this is the intellect and infinite curiosity of a scientist, maybe the courage and unfaltering bravery of a fire fighter. Let us go beyond the concept of a local hero and go into the realm of the most impactful people on the planet. People such as Martin Luther King, Winsto.

For the past, like, 4-6 months I've really wanted to go to a bar/club and DANCE. I've been getting more fit, I've been appreciating my body, a bunch of other life events I wont devolve into, and I've had this urge to go to a club and dance like I used to, like, 10-15 years ago. I was invited to a BBQ for one of the local pride/queer groups and so I went. I knew 2 of the ladies but upon arrival found I knew 1 or 2 others. But I don't So I have been waking up at 5 AM for the past two years and it has really changed my life, so I decided to share this post with you guys. TL;DR: Video Post (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w4vOxOmK6U) I believe that those who wake up early have a very clear advantage over the competition. While the competition is dreaming about success in the warmth of their beds, the early risers are up making shit happen. Here are my top five reasons on why you should wake up at 5 AM. ## Reason. Over the course of my life I've been a Jew, an Atheist, a staunch Anti-theist, a lukewarm member of a Restoration movement church (CofC, formerly RLDS), a Mormon (a bad one), and, finally, a Christian. At every point in this journey I've struggled. Sometimes with myself, sometimes with God, and sometimes with other believers. Ultimately though, this has been a personal walk for me, accompanied by Christ all along the way, who has patiently worked with me through my own stubbornness.
